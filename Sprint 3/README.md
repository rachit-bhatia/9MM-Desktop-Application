# Sprint 2
- All the Java Code for the application is present in the src.game folder of the Code Files Folder
- The UML and the Design Rationale docs are present in the Design Docs Folder

### Steps to run the application:
- The Application can be run by launching the jar file (9MM_DevDynasty.jar)
- In order to be able to run the jar file, the device should have at least Java Version 17.0.2 installed. Newer versions will also work.
- To install the correct JDK using IntelliJ Idea IDE, navigate to Project Structure in the File menu and choose SDK 17 under Project
- If there are any issues faced while launching 9MM_DevDynasty.jar, or it cannot be run, the 9MM application can still be launched by simply running the ApplicationDriver class file.

    For macOS, if the error regarding "Unidentified developer" is encountered, right click on the 9MM_DevDynasty.jar file and select 'Open'. Then select 'Open' from the dialog box that appears.
